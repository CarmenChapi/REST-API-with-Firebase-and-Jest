This project has been created to learn and play trying to create API with firebase


I follow this blog of how to create an API in firebase

https://medium.com/angular-in-depth/building-an-api-with-firebase-6108a207c1fd

After set up the database, I just try to test it with JEST, index.jest.js

- npm i jest
- npm i supertest

and add this to package.json
- "test": "jest â€” detectOpenHandles"

And I need to add this to de index.js
- module.exports = app;
